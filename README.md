# Audio-Transcriber-AI
Built a full-stack web app that converts audio to text using OpenAIâ€™s Whisper API. The backend, developed with Spring Boot and Spring AI, processes audio via RESTful APIs, while the React.js frontend allows users to upload files and view transcriptions in real time. API key-based authentication ensures secure OpenAI integration.
